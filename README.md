# Irrlicht-Terrain-Editor
A terrain editor in irrlicht with a gui

#COMPILING
To compile you'll need to first download a copy of irrlicht 1.8.3 and extract the folder
contained in the archive to the same folder as the project. Then you'll need to copy the
irrlicht.dll file to the project folder as well to ensure that the project runs. Next you'll
need to open the project file in codeblocks and compile. This project should tecnially
compile under any operating system that irrlicht supports but i've only included a codeblocks
project for windows.
