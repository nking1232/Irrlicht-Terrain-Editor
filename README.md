# Irrlicht-Terrain-Editor
A terrain editor in irrlicht with a gui

#COMPILING
To compile you'll need to first download a copy of irrlicht 1.8.3 and extract the folder
contained in the archive to the same folder as the project. Then you'll need to copy the
irrlicht.dll file to the project folder as well to ensure that the project runs. Next you'll
need to open the project file in codeblocks and compile. This project should tecnically
compile under any operating system that irrlicht supports but i've only included a codeblocks
project for windows.

#How To Use
Once you've compiled you can just press f8 to run the program while in code blocks.

moment you have to press it very fast or your mouse
will just dissapear again.
